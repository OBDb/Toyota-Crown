generations:
  - name: "First Generation (RS)"

    description: "The first-generation Toyota Crown established what would become Toyota's flagship sedan, representing the company's first true luxury offering. Featuring formal, somewhat American-influenced styling with pronounced fenders and substantial chrome accents typical of 1950s design, the original Crown was available in sedan, wagon, and commercial vehicle variants. Powered by a 1.5-liter (later 1.9-liter) four-cylinder engine with modest output, the Crown emphasized build quality and comfort over performance. The interior featured upscale appointments by Japanese standards of the era, with a focus on passenger comfort and premium materials. The first Crown also became Toyota's first export model to the United States in 1958, though it struggled in that market due to its modest power and size. Nevertheless, this generation established the Crown nameplate as Toyota's domestic flagship and began the model's long history as a conservative, well-built luxury car favored by executives, government officials, and taxi companies in Japan."

    description: "The fifteenth-generation Toyota Crown, the final iteration of the traditional Crown sedan, represented the pinnacle of Toyota's sedan development in its home market of Japan. Featuring elegant, conservative styling with a distinctive fastback-like silhouette, long hood, and short deck, this Crown maintained its position as a prestigious executive sedan. Available with multiple powertrains including a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, a 2.5-liter hybrid, and a 3.5-liter V6 hybrid delivering up to 359 combined horsepower, this Crown prioritized refined performance and efficiency. Built on the TNGA-N platform shared with the Lexus LS, the Crown offered a sophisticated double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension system for a premium ride quality. The interior featured high-quality materials throughout, with wood trim, leather upholstery, and advanced technology including a large center display, digital instrument cluster, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance features. This generation maintained the Crown's traditional values of quality, comfort, and prestige while incorporating modern technology and efficiency, serving as the final chapter of the traditional Crown sedan before the nameplate's radical reinvention for its sixteenth generation."

  - name: "Sixteenth Generation (Crown Crossover)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The sixteenth-generation Toyota Crown represents the most dramatic reinvention in the nameplate's history, transforming from a traditional sedan into a distinctive crossover sedan with elevated ride height and unique fastback proportions. This radical departure reflects shifting global market preferences while maintaining the Crown's premium positioning. Measuring 194 inches long with a 112.2-inch wheelbase, the new Crown features a polarizing design with a sloping roofline, bulging fenders, and an elevated stance (approximately 4 inches higher than a typical sedan), creating what Toyota calls a 'crossover sedan' that combines attributes of both body styles. Available globally—including the United States for the first time since 1972—this Crown is offered exclusively with hybrid powertrains. The standard system combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with electric motors for a combined 236 horsepower and all-wheel drive through a rear-mounted electric motor. The premium HYBRID MAX powertrain pairs a 2.4-liter turbocharged engine with an electric motor for 340 combined horsepower, featuring a direct-shift six-speed automatic transmission instead of the planetary continuously variable transmission used in the base system. The interior emphasizes premium comfort with standard heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, panoramic moonroof, and an 11-speaker JBL audio system on higher trims. Technology includes standard 12.3-inch touchscreen and digital instrument displays, wireless smartphone integration, and Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 with enhanced driver assistance features. This generation expands into a family of Crown-badged vehicles in some markets, including the Crown Sport, Crown Sedan, and Crown Estate, though only the crossover sedan variant is offered globally. The sixteenth-generation Crown attempts to maintain the model's traditional values of quality and prestige while adapting to contemporary market trends, appealing to consumers who desire a premium vehicle with distinctive styling that transcends traditional vehicle categories."
